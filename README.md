Hello I'm using github.<br>
I'm kinda noob, I've always tried to learn computing, but even scratching the surface.
At least lets enjoy.

# PSCP PuTTY or not
Im trying to learn how to use pscp from windows to raspbian, so I can transfer files and set a server for my webpages.
in documentation says: Starting PSCP: To start PSCP it will need either to be on your PATH or in your current directory. To add the directory containing PSCP to your PATH environment variable, type into the console window: set PATH=C:\path\to\putty\directory;%PATH%
but Im lost.
